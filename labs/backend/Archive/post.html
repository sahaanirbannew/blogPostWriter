  <h1>The Rufous-necked Hornbill of Latpanchar: A Jewel of the Eastern Himalayas</h1>

  <p>Hidden in the tranquil forests of Latpanchar, West Bengal, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous-necked_hornbill" target="_blank">Rufous-necked Hornbill</a> (<i>Aceros nipalensis</i>) thrives among the misty canopies. Known for its vibrant colors and unique calls, this hornbill is a rare and treasured sight—especially as it is now classified as <strong>Vulnerable</strong> on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss and hunting pressure.</p>

  <p>These hornbills are easily identified by their rufous-colored neck, a large downward-curving beak topped with a black casque, and vivid red, orange, and black plumage. Their calls echo across vast stretches of forest, helping individuals locate each other even at great distances. As <a href="https://birdfact.com/birds/rufous-necked-hornbill" target="_blank">BirdFact</a> notes, "These calls resonate through the forest, allowing the hornbills to communicate effectively even when far apart."</p>

  <p>On a crisp morning in March 2025, a particularly striking individual was spotted calmly perched among emerald leaves. Its orange, black, and blue feathers caught the light as it scanned its surroundings—perhaps listening for a mate’s call or scouting for fruit.</p>

  <p>Rufous-necked Hornbills are not just beautiful—they play a vital role in the forest ecosystem. These birds help disperse seeds of the fruit they consume, fostering biodiversity and forest regeneration. According to <a href="https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/runhor1/cur/introduction" target="_blank">Birds of the World</a>, "The Rufous-necked Hornbill plays a crucial role in seed dispersal, contributing to the health of tropical forests they inhabit."</p>

  <p>These images from Latpanchar capture not just the beauty of the bird but also a fading moment in nature. Sightings like these are becoming rarer. According to the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22682512/92941781" target="_blank">IUCN Red List</a>, the species is under pressure due to deforestation and illegal poaching.</p>

  <p>The Rufous-necked Hornbill is often compared to the more common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_hornbill" target="_blank">Great Hornbill</a>. While both have casques atop their bills, the Great Hornbill is larger and has predominantly black and white plumage. The Rufous-necked Hornbill, with its colorful facial markings and reddish collar, is more subtle but no less majestic.</p>

  <p>Latpanchar remains one of the few sanctuaries where birdwatchers, photographers, and conservationists can still glimpse this winged wonder. May it continue to thrive in the forests that echo with its call.</p>

  <h2>My Field Experience: Chasing Hornbills in Latpanchar</h2>

  <p>I took a train to New Jalpaiguri. From there, I hired a cab to Kalijhora market. My guide Ujwal picked me up on his scooty and took me to Latpanchar through winding forest roads.</p>

  <p>Soon after I arrived, Ujwal received a message from other guides—a pair of Rufous-necked Hornbills had been spotted. We rushed to the spot. They were far up in the trees and hard to see at first. But when I caught my first glimpse of the male and female courting—what a thrill! It was my first sighting of the year, and this was their courtship season.</p>

  <p>We hoped they would mate, but they flew away in opposite directions. That first day, I hadn’t brought my tripod. It was the first time I was seriously trying to make wildlife videos, so I was still learning.</p>

  <p>After breakfast, I returned to the homestay to rest. Around noon, Ujwal called again—"Get ready." I was already ready. He arrived hurriedly, and we set off again on his two-wheeler. First, we rode on paved roads, then took a shortcut—downhill, wild, no road. I closed my eyes at times, replaying happy memories as we bumped down the hill.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Ujwal stopped and started running. I followed. He knew the terrain; I didn’t. I had to jump over boulders, run over narrow logs, and follow him along paths barely a foot wide. Thankfully, I wore my running shoes and kept pace.</p>

  <p>We reached a house and climbed to the terrace. The male hornbill spotted us and seemed annoyed; the female moved to another branch. The male tried to court her again, and they later flew to a tree farther back. After 15 minutes of observation, the female flew away and the male followed.</p>

  <p>Ujwal dashed after them again, and I ran behind. We went downhill for over 200 meters until we reached an open area near fruit trees. Behind it was a deeper valley; in front, sparse trees with bare branches. The female perched on one, the male on another. Eventually, the female flew to join the male. I captured my best photograph here.</p>

  <p>On Day 2, we repeated this wild run—but this time, with a heavy tripod! We found the hornbills again near the same fruiting tree. I managed to shoot videos of the pair exchanging fruits—an intimate and playful moment of their courtship.</p>

  <p>Later, they perched again on the same branch from the previous day. I filmed them playing, and soon after, they flew off together. It was a deeply satisfying experience—witnessing their behavior so closely, capturing not just images but a memory.</p>
