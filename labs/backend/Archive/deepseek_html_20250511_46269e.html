    <p>The <span class="highlight">Rufous-necked Hornbill (Aceros nipalensis)</span> is one of the most striking avian species found in the forests of Latpanchar, West Bengal. Identified by its vibrant <span class="highlight">orange-rufous neck</span>, large yellow and black bill, and distinctive blue facial skin, this hornbill plays a crucial ecological role as a seed disperser in mature forest ecosystems. Classified as <span class="highlight">Vulnerable</span> by the IUCN, these birds are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, making sightings like those documented in March 2025 particularly valuable for conservation efforts.</p>

    <p>These hornbills exhibit fascinating behaviors that make them particularly interesting to ornithologists. They are <span class="highlight">monogamous</span>, forming lifelong pairs that work together to raise their young. The species shows significant <span class="highlight">sexual dimorphism</span>, with males displaying more vibrant coloration than females. As predominantly <span class="highlight">frugivorous</span> birds, they consume various fruits and play a vital role in forest regeneration through seed dispersal. Their preference for mature forests with large trees makes them an <span class="highlight">indicator species</span> for forest health in the Eastern Himalayan region.</p>

    <p>Distinguishing the Rufous-necked Hornbill from similar species like the Great Hornbill is relatively straightforward once you know what to look for. While the Great Hornbill has a more <span class="highlight">pronounced casque</span> and black-and-white plumage, our Rufous-necked subject boasts <span class="highlight">colorful facial skin</span> and that namesake reddish-brown neck. The images captured in Latpanchar beautifully showcase these distinguishing features, along with the bird's impressive size (they're among the larger hornbill species) and graceful movements through the forest canopy. Protecting these magnificent birds requires preserving their forest habitats - a challenge that becomes more urgent as deforestation pressures increase across their range.</p>
